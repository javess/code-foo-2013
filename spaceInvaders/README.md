DOM Space Invaders
=============

This implementation of space invaders was done 100% using javascript (with a little help from jQuery, underscore and jPlayer), html and css. 

It has been tested on Chrome and Safari and it runs B-E-A-utifully. 

I hope everyone enjoys this


Instructions
--------

*The ship is controled with the mouse. 
*Click or press spacebar to shoot.
*'P' pauses the game... useful for bathroom breaks or snack runs 
*Keeping spacebar pressed allows for continous shooting 
* **You only have one life. Be careful! **
* There is no end to this game... collect as many points as possible 
* I have a short memory span... there are no high scores... take screenshots or something for bragging rights 
* If you are killed, reset the game with the super cool reset button on the right. 
* We built no covers... hidding is not the bushido way
